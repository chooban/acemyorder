# What is it?

It's a frontend to CSV editing. It came about because I didn't enjoy 
scrolling through thousands of rows in a spreadsheet when ordering comics
from Ace Comics. 

I decided it might be nice to write myself a tool and learn some bits
and bobs in the process. Then I realised there was little point in only
running it on localhost so deployed it. 

Now people use it.
